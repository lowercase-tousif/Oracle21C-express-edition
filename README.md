# Installation of Oracle21C Express Edition in Ubuntu 22.04+

Pulling the image of Oracle21C express edition using docker 

So, first of all you need to install the docker . If you have the docker installed then it is great.

Follow the steps to setup the Oracle21C express edition 

Step-1:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

Step-2:
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

Step-3:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker --now
```

Step-4: Pull the Oracle21C express edition docker image 
```bash
sudo docker pull gvenzl/oracle-xe:21-slim
```

Step-5:
Run the command below for the initial password setup and container setup
```bash 
sudo docker run -d \
  --name oracle-xe \
  -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
  -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your-default-password> \
  gvenzl/oracle-xe:21-slim
```

Host-name: localhost
Port: 1521
Service Name: XEPDB1
User: system
Password: YourPassword123

`ORACLE_PASSWORD=<your-default-password>` carefully change the line here ORACLE_PASSWORD = set your password . it will be your default password. So, remember it.


### Check if the Oracle21C express edition installed or not

2.system/tousif@localhost/XEPDB1 change the tousif to your default password
3.Everytime you start the sql plus you need to execute the
--> sudo docker start oracle-xe-21c 
command

### Creating a new user

Here you don't need any kind of c## thing. You can create user without it.

```sql
CREATE USER tousiftasrik identified by tousif;
```

```sql
grant dba to tousiftasrik;
```

```sql
disconn;
```

```sql
conn;
```

```sql
Enter user-name: tousiftasrik
Enter password: tousif
```
